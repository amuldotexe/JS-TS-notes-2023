/* 
My dear Harry,

Understanding the depths of asynchronous programming requires us to experience it, not unlike our journey in the magical world. Let's explore these concepts with some examples.

To begin, imagine the spells in a wizard's duel as operations in a program. In a synchronous, or 'blocking' operation, each spell must take effect before the next one can be cast.
*/

function synchronousExample() {
  let spell1 = castSpell('Expelliarmus');
  console.log(`Casting spell 1: ${spell1}`);
  
  let spell2 = castSpell('Stupefy');
  console.log(`Casting spell 2: ${spell2}`);
}

synchronousExample();
// Console Output:
// Casting spell 1: Expelliarmus!
// Casting spell 2: Stupefy!

/* 
Notice how the second spell doesn't begin until the first one has fully taken effect.

In contrast, asynchronous operations are like casting spells that need time to work, such as a potion brewing or an owl delivering a message. We start the operation and then move on to other tasks, checking back later for the result.
*/

function asynchronousExample() {
  console.log('Start brewing the potion...');
  
  brewPotion('Polyjuice', function(potion) {
    console.log(`The potion is ready: ${potion}`);
  });
  
  console.log('While the potion is brewing, practice some spells...');
}

asynchronousExample();
// Console Output (could vary based on timing):
// Start brewing the potion...
// While the potion is brewing, practice some spells...
// The potion is ready: Polyjuice

/* 
Notice that we began practicing spells while the potion was still brewing. The potion was ready only after we finished practicing, illustrating the concurrent nature of JavaScript.

Now, Promises come into play when we want to handle these asynchronous operations more elegantly. Let's observe this with an example.
*/

function promiseExample() {
  let owlPromise = sendOwl('Hedwig', 'Hogsmeade');
  
  owlPromise.then(message => {
    console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
  }).catch(error => {
    console.log(`Error with owl delivery: ${error}`);
  });
  
  console.log('While Hedwig is away, time for a game of chess...');
}

promiseExample();
// Console Output (could vary based on timing):
// While Hedwig is away, time for a game of chess...
// Received message: Arrived at Hogsmeade!

/* 
Here, the owl's journey and the game of chess happen concurrently. But we have a clear way (through .then and .catch) to handle the owl's return message or any potential delivery errors, all thanks to the magic of Promises.

And that, Harry, is the essence of asynchronous programming and the role of Promises. The ability to cast spells while waiting for a potion to brew or an owl to return, and the capability to respond appropriately when these tasks are completed, that's the magic we've harnessed here.

With much regard,
Albus Dumbledore

/* 
Dear Harry,

Promises in JavaScript, akin to magical contracts in our world, represent an operation that hasn't completed yet but is expected in the future. They were introduced to solve the issues related to handling asynchronous operations, where actions do not follow the usual top-to-bottom flow, but occur outside the main program flow, just as magical events often lie outside the course of the ordinary world.

A Promise is, at its heart, an object with properties and methods. Much like an enchanted object, it starts in a pending state, neither fulfilled nor broken. This is like a magical oath that has been taken, but the outcome is yet to be seen.

When the operation is finished, the Promise becomes 'settled' - it might be 'fulfilled' if the operation was successful, or 'rejected' if an error occurred. This can be compared to the outcome of a magical task - it's either accomplished (fulfilled) or failed (rejected).

There are three states in the lifecycle of a Promise, akin to the journey a young wizard undertakes:

1. 'Pending': The initial state; neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. 'Fulfilled': The operation completed successfully.
3. 'Rejected': The operation failed.

A Promise is settled only once. It cannot change its state again, much like a wizard cannot change his allegiance once declared.

A Promise is said to be 'resolved' if it is either fulfilled or if it's not rejected, at least not yet. So, every fulfilled or pending Promise is also considered resolved. This is as though a magical challenge has been faced or is yet to be faced but has not been rejected.

A Promise has methods to which handlers are attached: '.then' for fulfillment, '.catch' for rejection, and '.finally' for any settlement. It's as though you can assign different spells to perform actions based on the outcome of a magical challenge.

A Promise gives us a way to handle the asynchronous operation's result or error, making code easier to read and reason about, like a well-written spell. It allows us to escape from the so-called "callback hell", a web of nested callbacks that are hard to manage and reason about - as maddening as trying to decipher an unfathomable prophecy.

One crucial note is that a Promise is always asynchronous, even if it's immediately resolved. The handlers attached to it are called in the next turn of the event loop. So, it's like casting a spell that takes effect not instantly but a moment later, allowing for other events to unfold.

Promises are now the basis of modern asynchronous patterns in JavaScript. They set the stage for async/await, a more advanced construct that makes asynchronous code appear synchronous. It's much like the advanced magic we delve into as we grow in our wizarding journey.

So, my dear boy, that is the magic of Promises. They encapsulate the very essence of time and events, a form of asynchronous sorcery, connecting our actions with the non-linear flow of time, as only a true wizard can.

Yours sincerely,
Albus Dumbledore

/* 
Dear Harry,

Promises are akin to the feeling of anticipation, the delicate hope you might hold for the future. A Promise in JavaScript, much like that hope, is an object that produces a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (an error).

Let's look at a simple example, akin to casting your first Lumos charm. 
*/

      Now, a Promise can either resolve (fulfill its duties) or be rejected (fail its mission). 
      Here we are making a simple calculation. If it sums up to 2, we'll say our spell (Promise) worked.
      */

        resolve('Success! Lumos!'); // We invoke the resolve function when what we were doing asynchronously was successful
      } else {
        reject('Failed! No light here...'); // We invoke the reject function when what we were doing asynchronously failed
      }
    })
  
    p.then(message => {
      /* 
      If our spell (Promise) was successful, we use .then to proceed with our journey, revealing our message of success. 
      */
      console.log("The result of the spell: " + message);
    }).catch(err => {
      /* 
      On the contrary, if our spell failed, we gracefully handle it using .catch, revealing the message of failure.

  /* 
Dear Harry,

Like the wizarding world, the realm of Promises is vast and filled with intricacies. Let's continue our journey. Next up, we have Promise.all. It's akin to calling upon all members of the Order of the Phoenix; all must successfully convene for the Promise to be resolved.
*/

    console.log(values);
  });
}

example4();
// Console Output: [ 'Sirius Black', 'Remus Lupin', 'Alastor Moody' ]

/* 
What if some of the Order members fail to convene, Harry? Promise.allSettled comes to our aid. It's a promise that fulfills when all the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with each promise's outcome. It's like knowing the status of all members, regardless of whether they were successful or not.
*/

function example5() {
  let promise1 = Promise.resolve('Nymphadora Tonks');
  let promise2 = Promise.reject('Severus Snape'); // Even if one member fails, we will get the statuses of all

    results.forEach((result, index) => {
      if(result.status === 'fulfilled') {
        console.log(`Promise ${index+1} fulfilled with value: ${result.value}`);

Promise 1 fulfilled with value: Nymphadora Tonks
Promise 2 rejected with reason: Severus Snape
Promise 3 fulfilled with value: Kingsley Shacklebolt
*/

/* 
Now, we move onto the concept of Promise.race, where the fastest promise wins, much like a Quidditch match! The Promise.race function returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.
*/

function example6() {

    console.log(`The fastest broomstick is: ${value}`);
  });
}

example6();
// Console Output: The fastest broomstick is: Firebolt

/* 
Now, we take a look at Promise.any, which behaves much like Promise.race, but only fulfills when the first promise fulfills. It's like waiting for the first correct answer in class, irrespective of the others.

  });
}

example7();
// Console Output: The first correct spell is: Expecto Patronum!

/* 
Now, let's get back to individual Promises and discuss a useful method: Promise.prototype.finally. It allows us to perform some action when the Promise is settled, irrespective of its outcome. It's like cleaning up the mess after a duel, regardless of who won.

  function Cruciatus() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

// The duel is over.
// or: 
// The result of the spell: Spell failed...

/* 
Let's make it a bit more complicated, Harry. Chaining promises is like brewing a potion - one step follows another, each dependent on the successful completion of the previous one.

/* 
Lastly, we will discuss async/await, a special syntax that works with Promises in a more comfortable fashion. It's like an improved version of spell casting where you don't have to wait for one spell to complete to start the next one.
