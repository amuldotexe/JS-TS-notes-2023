# Monthly Journal
10 July 2023 Monday

I do not feel like studying today, but I need to, hence will first focus on 1 hour of just revising whatever concepts I have learnt so far.

I will revise the following concepts:
- for loop

# Good prompt examples for ChatGPT

## For Loop Dumbledore Medium to Advanced

I'd like you to explain the JavaScript concept of for loops
- Please write comments in the style of Albus Dumbledore  - it should appear that he is directly explaining to us, as if we are Harry
- Please begin each comment with a blank line & the ""/*"" comment opener, then start your explanation on the next line. Similarly, end each comment with ""*/"" on a new line. Separate the comments & the code by at least one empty line for readability
- Put all of your writing in a JS code block only so that I can store these notes as JS files in my github repo

Ideally you would share each example as a function so that I can run the relevant function to play hands on with the code

Please share 5 examples from medium to advanced level of difficulty

Please do share the function call & relevant console.log output for each example


## Sample input and expected output

Please give a sample input and expected output for this function definition in JS:
function transformArray(arr, transformFunction) {
    let newArr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        newArr.push(transformFunction(arr[i]));
    }
    console.log(newArr);
}

## Morgan Freeman explaination of code

I'd like you to explain the JavaScript Code or concept below
- Please write comments in the style of Morgan Freeman
- Please begin each comment with a blank line & the ""/*"" comment opener, then start your explanation on the next line. Similarly, end each comment with ""*/"" on a new line. Separate the comments & the code by at least one empty line for readability
- Put all of your writing in a JS code block only so that I can store these notes as JS files in my github repo

Code / Concept Starts here:

### Prompt with Dumbledore explaining in 1 go

I'd like you to explain the JavaScript concept of for promises
- Please write comments in the style of Albus Dumbledore  - it should appear that he is directly explaining to us, as if we are Harry
- Please begin each comment with a blank line & the ""/*"" comment opener, then start your explanation on the next line. Similarly, end each comment with ""*/"" on a new line. Separate the comments & the code by at least one empty line for readability
- Put all of your writing in a JS code block only so that I can store these notes as JS files in my github repo

Ideally you would share each example as a function so that I can run the relevant function to play hands on with the code

Please share 15 examples from beginner to super-advanced level of difficulty

Please do share the function call & relevant console.log output for each example

At least in initial examples please be very slow and explicit in explaining the code assuming that the reader has never understood this concept or related meta concepts before
