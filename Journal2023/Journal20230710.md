# Monthly Journal
10 July 2023 Monday

I do not feel like studying today, but I need to, hence will first focus on 1 hour of just revising whatever concepts I have learnt so far.

I will revise the following concepts:
- for loop

## For Loop Dumbledore Easy to Medium

I'd like you to explain the JavaScript concept of for loops
- Please write comments in the style of Albus Dumbledore  - it should appear that he is directly explaining to us, as if we are Harry
- Please begin each comment with a blank line & the ""/*"" comment opener, then start your explanation on the next line. Similarly, end each comment with ""*/"" on a new line. Separate the comments & the code by at least one empty line for readability
- Put all of your writing in a JS code block only so that I can store these notes as JS files in my github repo

Ideally you would share each example as a function so that I can run the relevant function to play hands on with the code

Please share 5 examples from easy to medium level of difficulty
